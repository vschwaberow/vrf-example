# Verifiable Random Function (VRF) Rust example

A VRF, or verifiable random function, is a cryptographic primitive 
that allows one party (the prover) to generate a deterministic value 
that can be verified by another party (the verifier) to have been generated 
randomly. VRFs are useful for applications that require randomness in a 
distributed setting, such as randomness beacon protocols and leader 
election algorithms.

This repository shows example code how to implement it in Rust.
